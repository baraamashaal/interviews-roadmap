# 10.3 What are the differences between SPA, SSR, and SSG in Vue apps?

## Quick Revision
- SPA (Single Page Application) renders entirely on the client after initial bundle load; fastest builds but slower first render.
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering) renders HTML per request on the server, improving first paint and SEO with dynamic content.
- SSG (Static Site Generation) pre-renders pages at build time, serving static HTML with optional hydration for interactivity.

## Detailed Explanation
### SPA
Traditional Vue CLI or Vite setups build an SPA. The server sends a minimal HTML shell and a JavaScript bundle. Pros: simple deployment, dynamic interactivity. Cons: blank initial screen until JS loads, less SEO-friendly unless content is rendered client-side after fetch.

### SSR
SSR generates HTML on demand using server runtime (Node, Nitro). Pros include better Time to First Byte (TTFB), SEO, and social sharing metadata. Cons: increased server complexity, higher infrastructure cost, need to handle per-request state and caching.

### SSG
SSG builds HTML at compile time (Nuxt `nuxi generate`). Pros: CDN-friendly, low runtime cost, fast initial render. Cons: limited to content known at build time; dynamic data requires client fetching or incremental regeneration.

## Code Example
```bash
# Nuxt 3 rendering modes
nuxi dev        # hybrid (SSR during dev)
nuxi build      # produces server bundle for SSR
nuxi generate   # outputs static site (SSG)
```
