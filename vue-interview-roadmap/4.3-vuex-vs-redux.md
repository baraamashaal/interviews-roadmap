# 4.3 Compare Vuex with Redux. What are their strengths and weaknesses?

## Quick Revision
- Vuex is tightly integrated with Vue reactivity and mutations; Redux is framework-agnostic and uses pure reducers.
- Vuex mutations are synchronous, tracked by devtools, and leverage Vue’s reactivity for updates; Redux reducers return new immutable state objects.
- Vuex is simpler for Vue projects with modules/getters; Redux offers middleware ecosystem and explicit immutability but requires more boilerplate.

## Detailed Explanation
### Architecture
Vuex organizes state with mutations and actions. Mutations directly mutate state, and Vue’s reactivity detects changes. Actions handle async logic. Redux enforces pure reducers that accept `(state, action)` and return new state objects; immutability is required for change detection. Dispatching is asynchronous but reducers are synchronous.

### Tooling & Ecosystem
Vuex integrates with Vue Devtools, supporting time-travel debugging and module inspection. It leverages Vue’s plugin system and is configured once. Redux has a large middleware ecosystem (e.g., Redux Thunk, Redux Saga) and developer tools that integrate across frameworks. However, Redux typically requires more boilerplate for actions, reducers, and selectors.

### When to Choose
For Vue-centric applications, Vuex offers first-class support, minimal boilerplate, and direct compatibility with Composition API (`useStore`). Redux is valuable when sharing state logic across multiple frameworks or when you need advanced middleware patterns. Pinia (Vue’s next-gen store) combines strengths of both by embracing Composition API and TypeScript.

## Code Example
```js
// Redux-style reducer
function counter(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
Contrast with Vuex mutations that mutate state directly, relying on Vue’s reactive tracking instead of returning new objects.
