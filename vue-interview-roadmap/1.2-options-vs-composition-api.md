# 1.2 Can you explain the difference between the Options API and the Composition API?

## Quick Revision
- Options API organizes component logic by option (`data`, `methods`, `computed`), which can scatter related functionality across sections.
- Composition API uses the `setup()` function with `ref`, `reactive`, and composables to group logic by feature and improve reuse.
- Composition API unlocks better TypeScript inference, logic extraction, and sharing without mixins, while Options API remains simpler for small components.

## Detailed Explanation
### Options API Characteristics
In the Options API, you declare component state and behavior inside a configuration object. Vue merges options at runtime, providing clear lifecycle hooks (`created`, `mounted`) and automatic `this` binding. This approach is approachable and works well for small components. However, as components grow, related logic (e.g., authentication) ends up split between `data`, `computed`, `watch`, and `methods`, making refactoring and reuse harder.

### Composition API Characteristics
The Composition API exposes a `setup(props, context)` function that runs before component creation. You create reactive state with `ref` or `reactive`, derive values with `computed`, and expose features by returning them. Logic can be extracted to plain functions (composables) that return reactive primitives, avoiding the global namespace collisions of mixins. Types are easier to express, and code splitting by feature improves readability.

### Choosing Between Them
Use the Options API for smaller components or teams that prefer declarative structure. Choose Composition API when you need to reuse logic, share stateful utilities, or leverage advanced TypeScript. Both APIs can coexist, and the `<script setup>` SFC syntax reduces boilerplate for Composition API code.

## Code Example
```vue
<!-- Options API -->
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return { count: 0 };
  },
  computed: {
    double() {
      return this.count * 2;
    },
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++;
    },
  },
};
</script>

<!-- Composition API with <script setup> -->
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue';

const count = ref(0);
const double = computed(() => count.value * 2);
const increment = () => count.value++;
</script>
```
