# 10.1 What is Vue SSR and how does Nuxt.js help with server-side rendering?

## Quick Revision
- Vue SSR renders components to HTML on the server, improving perceived performance and SEO.
- The Vue SSR API (`@vue/server-renderer`) turns Vue apps into server-rendered HTML with hydration on the client.
- Nuxt.js provides a higher-level framework for SSR/SSG, handling routing, data fetching, and deployment optimizations.

## Detailed Explanation
### Vue SSR Basics
Server-side rendering involves running Vue components on the server to produce HTML, sending it to the client, and hydrating it with client-side JavaScript. Vue’s SSR renderer serializes the app tree with current state. Hydration attaches event listeners and reuses DOM instead of re-rendering.

### Challenges & Solutions
SSR requires handling async data fetching, managing per-request state, and ensuring deterministic output. You must avoid browser-only APIs during server render. Caching rendered pages and streaming can improve performance.

### Nuxt.js Advantages
Nuxt builds on Vue SSR by providing file-based routing, data fetching hooks (`asyncData`, `useFetch`), automatic code splitting, and deployment presets (SSR, SSG, Hybrid). It abstracts SSR boilerplate, offers modules (auth, i18n), and optimizes bundling via Nitro server.

## Code Example
```js
// server.js
import { createSSRApp } from 'vue';
import { renderToString } from '@vue/server-renderer';
import App from './App.vue';

const app = createSSRApp(App);
const html = await renderToString(app);
```
