# Front-End Interview Roadmap

Welcome! This site gathers concise study notes and curated resources to help you prepare for modern front-end interviews. While the first module spotlights Vue, the plan is to steadily expand into framework-agnostic fundamentals and other ecosystems (React, Angular, performance engineering, accessibility, and more).

## What you'll find here
- **Concept summaries:** Digestible explanations of core browser, JavaScript, and framework topics.
- **Interview preparation tracks:** Step-by-step outlines to review concepts, practice exercises, and whiteboard prompts.
- **Reference checklists:** Quick reminders for common pitfalls, optimization tips, and best practices.

## How to use this guide
1. Start with the roadmap that matches your immediate goals.
2. Use the provided checklists to self-assess and identify knowledge gaps.
3. Extend the notes with your own examples or links to articles and documentation.
