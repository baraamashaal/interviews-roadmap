# 6.6 What is Teleport in Vue 3 and when would you use it?

## Quick Revision
- `Teleport` renders component content into a different part of the DOM while preserving reactivity.
- Use it for overlays, modals, tooltips, or portals that need to escape CSS/DOM hierarchy constraints.
- Teleported content still belongs to the Vue component tree, so props, events, and reactivity work normally.

## Detailed Explanation
### How Teleport Works
`<Teleport to="#modal-root">` moves its slot content to the target element elsewhere in the DOM. Vue keeps the component in the logical tree, so state and lifecycle behave as if it were inline, but the rendered DOM lives at the target location. The target can be any CSS selector or DOM node.

### Use Cases
Teleport solves z-index and overflow issues for modals or popovers by rendering them at the document root. It’s also useful for rendering inside iframes or shadow DOM hosts. Because events bubble within Vue’s virtual tree, you can emit events or access provide/inject normally.

### Considerations
Ensure the target element exists before Teleport renders; create it in HTML or mount hook. Teleport supports conditional rendering and can disable teleporting with the `disabled` prop. When server-side rendering, ensure matching structure between server and client to avoid hydration issues.

## Code Example
```vue
<template>
  <Teleport to="#portal">
    <div class="modal" v-if="open">
      <button @click="$emit('close')">Close</button>
      <slot />
    </div>
  </Teleport>
</template>
```
