# 7.3 What are some common Vue testing strategies (unit testing, integration testing, snapshot testing)?

## Quick Revision
- Unit tests isolate components/composables with tools like Vitest or Jest plus Vue Test Utils.
- Integration tests render multiple components or routes together to verify interactions and store/router integration.
- Snapshot tests capture rendered output for regression checks but should complement functional assertions.

## Detailed Explanation
### Unit Testing
Use Vue Test Utils to mount components with stubbed dependencies. Test props, emitted events, computed properties, and DOM output. Vitest offers fast ESM-based runs; Jest is common in legacy setups. Mock HTTP requests and global services to isolate behavior.

### Integration Testing
Render components with their child dependencies, router, and store to verify flows like navigation or form submission. Cypress Component Testing or Playwright can render Vue components in a real browser for higher fidelity. Keep integration tests focused on critical paths to balance speed and coverage.

### Snapshot Testing
Snapshot tests compare the rendered markup against stored snapshots, catching unintended structural changes. Use sparingly and alongside targeted assertions to avoid brittle tests. Update snapshots intentionally when UI changes are expected.

## Code Example
```js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Counter from './Counter.vue';

describe('Counter', () => {
  it('increments on click', async () => {
    const wrapper = mount(Counter);
    await wrapper.find('button').trigger('click');
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('1');
  });
});
```
