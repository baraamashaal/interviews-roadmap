# 1.5 What are the key differences between v-if and v-show?

## Quick Revision
- `v-if` conditionally renders elements, adding/removing them from the DOM; `v-show` toggles the `display` CSS property.
- `v-if` has higher toggle cost but no initial render cost when false; `v-show` always renders once but toggles cheaply.
- Use `v-if` for infrequent conditional content (e.g., modal), `v-show` for frequent toggling (e.g., tabs).

## Detailed Explanation
### Rendering Behavior
`v-if` controls whether Vue creates or destroys a component subtree. When the condition is false, Vue removes listeners, child components, and DOM nodes. This saves initial work when the condition is rarely true but incurs a cost each toggle. `v-show` renders the element once and simply sets `display: none` when false, preserving the DOM structure and component state.

### Performance Considerations
`v-if` lazily evaluates the branch, so expensive components are skipped entirely until needed. However, toggling often can hurt performance due to repeated mounting/unmounting. `v-show` guarantees a one-time render cost and constant-time toggling, ideal for frequently shown/hidden elements where initial render cost is acceptable.

### Side Effects & Accessibility
Because `v-show` keeps elements in the DOM, focus, component state, and watchers remain active even when hidden—useful for cached forms but potentially problematic for accessibility if hidden elements remain focusable. With `v-if`, watchers and child lifecycle hooks fire each time the branch is toggled.

## Code Example
```vue
<template>
  <button @click="show = !show">Toggle</button>

  <HeavyChart v-if="show" />
  <p v-show="show">This text toggles display only.</p>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import HeavyChart from './HeavyChart.vue';

const show = ref(false);
</script>
```
