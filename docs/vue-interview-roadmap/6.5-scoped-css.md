# 6.5 How does scoped CSS work in Vue?

## Quick Revision
- `<style scoped>` in SFCs transforms selectors with unique data attributes to limit styles to the component.
- Scoped styles apply using attribute selectors (e.g., `[data-v-123abc]`), preserving component isolation.
- Use deep selectors (`::v-deep`) or global styles for styling child components and third-party libraries.

## Detailed Explanation
### Compilation Process
When compiling an SFC with `<style scoped>`, Vue injects a unique attribute (e.g., `data-v-1a2b3c`) into the component’s root and child elements. CSS selectors in the scoped block are rewritten to include that attribute, ensuring they target only elements in the component.

### Working with Child Components
Scoped styles do not penetrate child components by default. To style child components, use the `::v-deep` combinator or global styles. For example, `::v-deep(.child)` applies to descendant components. Alternatively, create shared CSS modules or global stylesheets for consistent branding.

### Considerations
Scoped CSS increases specificity but doesn’t guarantee isolation from global resets. Use CSS modules (`<style module>`) for hashed class names or utility frameworks (Tailwind). Remember that scoped styles are still processed by PostCSS/Babel, so autoprefixing works.

## Code Example
```vue
<template>
  <div class="card">
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.card {
  border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
</style>
```
