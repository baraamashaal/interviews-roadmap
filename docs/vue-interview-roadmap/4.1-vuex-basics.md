# 4.1 What are the basics of Vuex and how does it differ from local component state?

## Quick Revision
- Vuex provides a centralized store with state, getters, mutations, and actions for predictable state management across components.
- Local component state is encapsulated within a component; Vuex enables global sharing, time-travel debugging, and devtools integration.
- Vuex enforces unidirectional data flow: components dispatch actions → actions commit mutations → mutations synchronously update state.

## Detailed Explanation
### Core Concepts
Vuex organizes global state in a single store. `state` is the reactive data source, `getters` derive computed values, `mutations` are synchronous operations that change state, and `actions` handle asynchronous logic before committing mutations. Modules allow namespacing.

### Differences from Local State
Local component state suits UI-specific data that doesn’t need to be shared. When multiple components need consistent state (e.g., authentication, cart), Vuex centralizes logic, reduces prop drilling, and makes mutations traceable. Vue Devtools records mutation history for debugging and supports time travel.

### Workflow & Best Practices
Components access state via `useStore()` or helpers like `mapState`. They dispatch actions instead of committing mutations directly to keep asynchronous effects centralized. Mutations must be synchronous to keep devtools logs deterministic. Use modules to segment domains and enable lazy-loaded modules for code splitting.

## Code Example
```js
// store/index.js
import { createStore } from 'vuex';

export default createStore({
  state: () => ({ count: 0 }),
  getters: {
    double: (state) => state.count * 2,
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    },
  },
  actions: {
    asyncIncrement({ commit }) {
      setTimeout(() => commit('increment'), 300);
    },
  },
});
```
