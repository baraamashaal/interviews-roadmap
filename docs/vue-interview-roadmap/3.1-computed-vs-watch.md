# 3.1 How do computed properties differ from watchers?

## Quick Revision
- Computed properties derive reactive values with caching; they re-evaluate only when dependencies change.
- Watchers run side effects in response to reactive changes, ideal for async work or imperative tasks.
- Prefer computed properties for declarative data transformations; use watchers for effects requiring callbacks.

## Detailed Explanation
### Computed Properties
A computed property wraps a getter function in a lazy effect. Vue tracks dependencies during evaluation and caches the result until dependencies change. Computed props can be read like data in templates and are ideal for derived state, complex calculations, and chaining with other computed values. Writable computed props define both `get` and `set`.

### Watchers
`watch(source, callback)` observes one or more reactive sources (refs, getters, arrays) and executes a callback when they change. Watchers expose the new and previous value, support `immediate` execution, and can be flushed `post`, `pre`, or `sync`. `watchEffect` runs a reactive effect immediately and re-runs whenever dependencies change, making it great for concise side effects.

### Choosing the Right Tool
Computed props should remain pure and free of side effects, ensuring templates stay declarative. Watchers are necessary when you need to respond to changes with asynchronous logic, manual DOM interaction, or integration with external APIs. Avoid watchers for trivial transformations that could be computed props.

## Code Example
```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed, watch } from 'vue';

const first = ref('Ada');
const last = ref('Lovelace');
const fullName = computed(() => `${first.value} ${last.value}`);

watch(fullName, (newName, oldName) => {
  console.log(`Name changed from ${oldName} to ${newName}`);
});
</script>

<template>
  <p>{{ fullName }}</p>
</template>
```
